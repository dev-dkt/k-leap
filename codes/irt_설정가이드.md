The error message you're seeing indicates that downgrading NumPy to version **1.23.5** conflicts with other packages in your environment that require a newer version of NumPy (e.g., `albumentations`, `xarray`). This is a common issue when multiple packages have overlapping but incompatible dependencies.

**Best Solution: Use a Virtual Environment**

To resolve this issue without affecting your existing packages, I recommend creating a new virtual environment specifically for running the IRT analysis. This way, you can manage package versions independently without causing conflicts in your main environment.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a New Virtual Environment

#### 1. **Install `virtualenv` or Use `conda` Environments**

- **Option A: Using `virtualenv` (for pip users)**
  
  ```bash
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

- **Option B: Using `conda` (if you're using Anaconda/Miniconda)**
  
  You already seem to be using Anaconda, so you can proceed with `conda`.

#### 2. **Create a New Virtual Environment**

- **Using `conda`:**

  ```bash
  conda create -n irt_env python=3.9
  ```

- **Using `virtualenv`:**

  ```bash
  virtualenv irt_env
  ```

#### 3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

- **Using `conda`:**

  ```bash
  conda activate irt_env
  ```

- **Using `virtualenv` (Linux/Mac):**

  ```bash
  source irt_env/bin/activate
  ```

- **Using `virtualenv` (Windows):**

  ```bash
  irt_env\Scripts\activate
  ```

#### 4. **Install Necessary Packages**

In the new environment, install the packages needed for the IRT analysis.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas pymc aesara
```

**Note:** We are installing the latest versions of `numpy`, `pandas`, `pymc`, and `aesara`. This setup avoids the compatibility issues with `numpy` and `Theano` since `pymc` (version 4 and above) uses `aesara`.

#### 5. **Run the Updated Python Code**

Use the updated code compatible with PyMC 4:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pymc as pm

# Read the CSV file with the correct encoding
df = pd.read_csv('응답_데이터.csv', encoding='utf-8')

# Function to convert OX strings to binary responses
def ox_to_binary(ox_string):
    return [1 if char == 'O' else 0 for char in ox_string]

# Apply the function to the 'OX리스트' column
df['responses'] = df['OX리스트'].apply(ox_to_binary)

# Create a DataFrame of responses
response_data = pd.DataFrame(df['responses'].tolist())

# Convert response_data to a NumPy array
data = response_data.values

# Number of examinees and items
n_examinees, n_items = data.shape

# Build the IRT model using PyMC 4
with pm.Model() as irt_model:
    # Ability parameters for each examinee
    theta = pm.Normal('theta', mu=0, sigma=1, shape=n_examinees)
    
    # Difficulty parameters for each item
    beta = pm.Normal('beta', mu=0, sigma=1, shape=n_items)
    
    # Discrimination parameters for each item (2PL model)
    alpha = pm.HalfNormal('alpha', sigma=1, shape=n_items)
    
    # Expected probability of correct response
    p = pm.math.sigmoid(alpha * (theta[:, None] - beta))
    
    # Likelihood (observed data)
    observed = pm.Bernoulli('observed', p=p, observed=data)
    
    # Sample from the posterior distribution
    trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, cores=2, random_seed=42, return_inferencedata=True)
    
# Extract estimated item parameters
alpha_est = trace.posterior['alpha'].mean(dim=['chain', 'draw']).values
beta_est = trace.posterior['beta'].mean(dim=['chain', 'draw']).values

# Extract estimated person abilities
theta_est = trace.posterior['theta'].mean(dim=['chain', 'draw']).values

# Output the results
print('Estimated Item Discrimination Parameters (alpha):')
print(alpha_est)

print('\nEstimated Item Difficulty Parameters (beta):')
print(beta_est)

print('\nEstimated Person Ability Parameters (theta):')
print(theta_est)
```

#### 6. **Additional Package Installations (If Needed)**

If you encounter any import errors for packages like `arviz` (used by PyMC for plotting and summarizing), install them as well:

```bash
pip install arviz
```

#### 7. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

After you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

- **Using `conda`:**

  ```bash
  conda deactivate
  ```

- **Using `virtualenv`:**

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

### Explanation and Benefits

- **Isolated Environment:** By creating a new environment, you avoid conflicts with other projects and packages installed in your main environment.
  
- **Latest Versions:** Using the latest versions of packages ensures better compatibility and access to new features and optimizations.

- **Avoiding Deprecated Packages:** Upgrading to PyMC 4 (or the latest PyMC) avoids issues with Theano, which is no longer maintained and incompatible with newer versions of NumPy.

### Alternative Solution: Adjusting Package Versions

If creating a new virtual environment is not feasible, you can adjust package versions in your current environment, but this may break other packages:

1. **Check All Package Dependencies:**

   - Run `pip check` to see all dependency conflicts.
   - Decide which packages are essential and which can be adjusted.

2. **Install Compatible Versions:**

   - For example, install a version of `albumentations` compatible with NumPy 1.23.5 or find an alternative.

3. **Use `pip install --ignore-installed`:**

   - Force install specific versions (not recommended as it may break other packages).

### Final Recommendation

Creating a new virtual environment is the safest and most effective way to proceed without disrupting your existing projects and packages.
